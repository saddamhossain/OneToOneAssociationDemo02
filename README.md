The vehicle registration authority requires a system to manage car details and their associated license plates.

Each car must be assigned a unique license plate that includes attributes like the plate number, registration date, and expiration date.

The system must validate the license plate by ensuring it is current and not expired. Additionally, the system should track the carâ€™s owner information, manufacturer, model, and year of manufacture.

It must also calculate the age of the car to determine if it qualifies for registration renewal and compliance with emission standards.
